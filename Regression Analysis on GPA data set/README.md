### GPA Data Set
- Data source: https://canvas.tufts.edu/courses/30820/files/folder/Homework/Homework%202?
- Data description:
- X1 = sat = combined SAT score
- X2 = tothrs = total hours through fall semester
- X3 = hsize = size graduating class in 100â€™s
- X4 = hsrank = rank in graduating class
- X5 = hsperc = 100*(hsrank/hssize)
- Y = colgpa = GPA after fall semester



- Tasks:
- 1) For each of the predictors, X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, fit a simple linear regression model to predict the response.
- 2) Fit a multiple regression model to predict the response using all of the predictors for which were rejected using the null hypothesis.
